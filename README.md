Decentralized Subscription Automation for Web3

SubStream is a decentralized subscription management system built on blockchain, leveraging Kwala‚Äôs decentralized automation to make recurring payments fully autonomous, secure, and transparent. It removes the need for intermediaries or manual renewals, creating a seamless subscription experience for both users and service providers.

## üîÆ Vision
